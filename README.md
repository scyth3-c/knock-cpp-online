# knock-cpp-online
_a small webapp to compile c++ online testing the full version of scyth3-c/knock-api-ts_


currently there is no color highlighting for key words and the reason for this is to integrate the api to [knocknotes](https://github.com/scyth3-c/vue-conponents)
to compile the c++ code that can be embedded in the notes

## app

_the api is hosted on heroku with the free dynos which means that when reactivating it, it takes a while to start up._
